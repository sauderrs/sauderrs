### Hello World!

Welcome to my profile 🙃

#### 👩🏼‍💻 Development
I am a full-stack engineer working on a little bit of this and that at [Ramsey Solutions](https://www.ramseyinhouse.com/).
Right now, that looks like React apps, Ruby on Rails apps and REST APIs, and Magnolia CMS light module development.

My team focuses on products related to [educating students about personal finance](https://www.ramseyeducation.com/) -- a topic that is near and dear to my heart.

#### 🌺 Personal
When I'm not developing...  
I really enjoy a good movie 📽, going for a hike 🏞, having a board game night w/ friends ♟, and horseback riding 🏇.
